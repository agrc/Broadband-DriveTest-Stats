# Broadband-DriveTest-Stats
Aggregate statistics on the mobile broadband drive test data.

This script was created to aggregate the downlink, uplink, and signal data from the broadband drive test points.
- It aggregates fields from the points to roads segments based on proximity.
- The script was designed to run as a stand alone arcpy program but it could easily be adapted to a script tool interface.
- It was designed to run with ArcGIS 10.2
